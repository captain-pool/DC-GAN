# Keras Implementation of DCGAN
Keras Implementation of Deep Convolutional GAN on MNIST Dataset of Handwritten Digits
Research Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf 

To Get started fireup a terminal:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Couldn't train completely, as the system froze due to insufficient resources. So the visualization is not that accurate. Upon training extensively, indistinguishable images will be produced.
